    "Thanjavur":"Initially, Thanjavur was ruled by a local Telugu dynasty descending from the governors appointed by Vijayanagar. However, a Maratha general in the service of Bijapur named Shahaji conquered Thanjavur, turning it into his personal fiefdom and giving it to his son Ekoji. Eventually, another son of Shahaji, by the name of Shivaji, conquered the Thanjavur kingdom, allowing its rulers to stay on if they paid an annual tribute. ",
    "Venad":"Venad, which despite largely independent paid tribute to Madurai, was far from cohesive. It faced rebellion by a coalition of eight nobles and a string of weak rulers. This state of disrepair was only ended by Marthanda Varma in the early eighteenth century, who turned Venad into the far more well-known kingdom of Travancore.",
    "Salsette Island":"Salsette Island, and especially its main fort and port of Bombay, became a major focal point of trade and eventually became the economic capital of British India some time after having been taken by the British. ",
    "Goa":"At one point many Indian ports were controlled by Portugal. Over time, it lost its dominions. Salsette Island was given to England as a dowry gift, Chittagong was lost to pirates and then the Mughals, and Ceylon was lost to the Dutch. The Portuguese only kept hold over Goa and a few ports, which it held on until Indian independence. Today, a strong Portuguese legacy exists in Goa as a direct result of this colonization.",
    "Cochin":"A major trading port, Portuguese influence soon gave way to the Dutch, who generally ruled with a much lighter hand than the conflict, power struggles, and internal revolts that marked Portuguese rule.",
    "Calicut":"Having been the place where Vasco da Gama's fleet first met India, Calicut had for a long time been a focal point of Portuguese influence in India. As that influence receded, much influence instead went to the Dutch who replaced them. A major point of Indo-European trade, Calicut was an extremely wealthy despite being involved in a conflict of influence with Cannanore just to its north.",
    "Toungoo":"Largely irrelevant to the affairs of the Indian subcontinent.",
    "Kumaon":"Kumaon was, as a result of being in highly mountainous terrain, only a Mughal tributary with no real Mughal control beyond a firm alliance. Recently, this alliance led to an extremely successful invasion of the less hilly and richer parts of Garhwal. ",
    "Tripura":"Originally having a non-Indic religion, this religion was swept aside after lots and lots of Bengali influence led to it being thrown aside. Although many local deities were retained, local religion merged with Hinduism. Extensive Bengali influence resulted in a large Bengali population, which lives in Tripura to this day. More recently, Mughal influence led to Tripura becoming an Indian client state. ",
    "Ladakh":"Ladakh was in the middle of a war at this time with Tibet. Having long ago broke away from the territorial control of the Dalai Lama, it slowly became more and more Mughal-influenced, with Aurangzeb creating a mosque in Leh. Even today, despite many cultural similarities with Tibet, Ladakh is more Indianized and has a much larger Muslim minority than Tibet. In its war with Tibet, it got the help of the Mughal Empire, and when the war came to an end, it ultimately retained its independence.",
    "Cannanore":"Cannanore was one of Kerala's great thalassocracies, having been involved in an extensive conflict of influence with Calicut. Although formerly influenced by the Portuguese and Dutch, at around this point, numerous other European states established their factories at Cannanore, thus diversifying its trade. It was also at around this period that numerous feudal lords began to take power away from the centre at Cannanore.",
    "Badakhstan":"Largely irrelevant in the affairs of the Indian subcontinent, save for a brief moment in which it was taken by the Mughals in the 1640s. ",
    "Uzbek Khanate":"Largely irrelevant in the affairs of the Indian subcontinent, save for a brief moment in which Balkh was taken by the Mughals in the 1640s. Notable in that Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, originally came from the Uzbek Khanate. ",
    "Mewar":"As a result of the death of the ruler of the Mughal vassal of Marwar, a succession crisis opened up. The candidate supported by the Mughals, Indra Singh, was not supported by many Rajputs, who instead supported the infant Ajit Singh as its ruler. However, the neighbouring kingdom Mewar got involved as well in favour of Ajit Singh. The rebellion was all but crushed and the Rajputs were all but integrated when Aurangzeb's son Prince Akbar rebelled against his father, proclaiming himself emperor in early January, 1681. If he had charged in immediately after his declaration, he would have likely won, but he waited a few weeks, allowing Aurangzeb to successfully trick Akbar's Rajput allies into abandoning him, forcing Akbar to flee to the Maratha Empire, resulting in an angry Aurangzeb invading the Maratha Empire.",
    "Marwar":"As a result of the death of the ruler of the Mughal vassal of Marwar, a succession crisis opened up. The candidate supported by the Mughals, Indra Singh, was not supported by many Rajputs, who instead supported the infant Ajit Singh as its ruler. However, the neighbouring kingdom Mewar got involved as well in favour of Ajit Singh. The rebellion was all but crushed and the Rajputs were all but integrated when Aurangzeb's son Prince Akbar rebelled against his father, proclaiming himself emperor in early January, 1681. If he had charged in immediately after his declaration, he would have likely won, but he waited a few weeks, allowing Aurangzeb to successfully trick Akbar's Rajput allies into abandoning him, forcing Akbar to flee to the Maratha Empire, resulting in an angry Aurangzeb invading the Maratha Empire.",
    "Dzungar Khanate":"Largely irrelevant to the affairs of the Indian subcontinent.",
    "Kandy":"Kandy emerged to become the predominant native Sri Lankan power on the island from the 1590s, with the old relic of Buddha's tooth moved to the city of Kandy. After the 1640s, when Dutch help was used to remove the Portuguese, relations deteriorated to the point that fighting between the two became intermittent until the end of Dutch rule meant an end to conflict between the two. ",
    "Dutch Ceylon":"After the removal of the Portuguese, Dutch control of Ceylon expanded further and further, until the Kingdom of Kandy was only in control of inland territory, and Dutch control was only lost during the French Revolutionary Wars, when it was occupied by Britain.",
    "Nepali states":"Nepal was a highly fractured region. Even the Kathmandu Valley, a small place, had three kingdoms. The region was, as one would expect, highly Mughal-influenced as can be seen by its paintings, even though real control was impossible thanks to its mountainous terrain.",
    "Kerala states":"Kerala was once under the control of the Chera Empire. However, the Chera gradually weakened and a feudal system intensified, to the point that the power of the Chera became theoretical. Eventually, the theoretical entity itself was removed, and Kerala was transformed into many minor states, with a few major thalassocracies existing in the region.",
    "Dardic states":"This territory was once under the control of Skardu. However, Skardu gradually splintered away into many pieces as the mountainous terrain of the region made long-term control impossible. This territory was under the control of numerous small states, and as trade routes generally existed in its south, there was really no real need for any neighbouring states to conquer them. ",
    "Tibet":"It was at around this point that Tibet became a theocratic state, ruled by the Dalai Lama rather than any king. It was also fairly powerful, at this point, and in Indian affairs it was attempting an invasion of Ladakh, something which required the intervention of the Mughal Empire to defeat. ",
    "Safavid Empire":"The Safavid Empire was the Mughal Empire's great rival. Having once upon a time helped it in regaining its power from the Afghans, since then relations totall and utterly deteriorated with both kingdoms fighting over Kandahar. This fight eventually ended when the Afghans themselves took Kandahar and raided both India and Persia. ",
    "Madurai":"Madurai was formerly suzerain to Vijayanagar, but that had long since become little more than words on a paper. By this point, Madurai was in decline, with Mysore having conquered Erode and soon conquering much, much more. Ramnad was also a bit of a difficulty, with its vassal rulers increasingly attempting to assert their independence against Madurai. Eventually, these difficulties grew more and more severe, and Madurai was a minor rump state by the time Britain finally put it out of its misery.",
    "Mysore":"Mysore was, at this point, a minor kingdom, having only a few decades ago unified the region from a fractured mess. However, this changed by a couple decades after 1680 under its first great ruler Chikka Deva Raja who successfully navigated the difficult politics of the era, after which point it stretched over much of the Southern Deccan, beginning a long period of expansion. When the Mughals came knocking in the 1690s, Mysore became a tributary state, but when the Mughals collapsed, it became independent once more (though a friendship between them was established), and it required four wars by the British to conquer, two of which actually ended in Mysorean victory.",
    "Keladi":"Keladi was initially founded as a region totally suzerain to Vijayanagar, with its ruler's title of \"Nayak\" initially meaning \"governor\", but as Vijayanagar weakened further and further, as the capital was captured, increasingly the Nayaks became independent. Though Vijayanagar only \"officially\" was vanquished a little while before 1680, in reality it had been vanquished for a very long time. Keladi was ruled by followers of the Lingayat sect, a Shaivite sect of Hinduism (or its own religion, it's very muddled), and its rulers were fiercely independent but able to keep positive relations with virtually every surrounding kingdom.",
    "Maratha Empire":"The Maratha Empire, founded by Shivaji, a man whose memory is to this day invoked by Indian politicians, emerged on the scene quite suddenly. Though Shivaji's own father was a conquerer in his own right, he fought in the name of Bijapur. By this point, the Maratha Empire successfully invaded land as far as the Carnatic, with multiple successful campaigns having expanded the Empire's reach, and having raided Mughal cities as far north as Surat, obtaining plenty of plunder. Furthermore, the southerly kingdom of Thanjavur, formerly conquered by Shivaji's father, ruled by his half-brother Ekoji, was vassalized by the Maratha Empire. However, at around this time, he died, resulting in a succession crisis ultimately won by his son Shambhaji, a figure who is not anywhere near as well remembered. Regardless, in time, the Maratha Empire invaded much of North India, and in several decades' time, it was able to dominate India itself.",
    "Bijapur":"Bijapur was facing civil war as its sultan was not of age. The Maratha Empire was increasingly ignoring its rule, establishing numerous exclaves in Bijapuri territory. Its court preferred wine to rule, and naturally it resulted in defeat at the hands of the Maratha Empire all round. This didn't totally destroy Bijapur, however; Mughal invasion a few years later was required for that.",
    "Golconda":"Golconda was a highly prosperous sultanate, withs its diamond mines having achieved fame for their high quality. Aurangzeb set it aside for future conquest, as he felt it would fold easily, and he turned out to be right. Although in terms of southern expansion Bijapur outmatched it, Golconda wasn't facing any crisis anywhere near close to the Maratha Empire, and in fact even used the Marathas to conquer some border regions.",
    "Arakan":"Arakan was influenced by Bengal for centuries. Its rulers constantly compared themselves to Bengali Sultans and later Mughal Emperors. More recently, Chittagong became a centre of piracy, especially Portuguese, and this was used by the Mughals to conquer Chittagong as well as much of coastal Arakan, demonstrating the ease by which they could conquer the country if they ever wanted to. Thankfully for them, the Deccan was far more attractive to the Mughals.",
    "Kangleipak":"Kangleipak was, and still is (if for different reasons), a highly unique part of Northeast India. Not connected to the rest of India by riverine networks, the nation was able to, fairly independently, create a cohesive state that was able to defend itself from Naga and Kuki tribes on its border. At around this time, however, Indian influence was growing, and in the early eighteenth century, it was converted to Hinduism by Chaitanya Vaishnavite missionaries. The kingdom was promptly given a Sanskrit name, one which has stuck to the modern day. It became known as Manipur.",
    "Ahom":"The Ahom Kingdom was fairly resistant, defeating an invasion by the far larger and richer Mughal Empire which temporarily was able to take the capital at Gargaon but ultimately failed. It was the strongest nation in Northeast India, with it being far more cohesive than any part of the region save for Kangleipak and Tripura. It saw some confusion thanks to the invasion, but the kingdom recovered and only destabilized again shortly before British invasion.",
    "Mughal Empire":"The Mughal Empire was perhaps the richest nation in all of the subcontinent. In sheer size, it overshadowed virtually every other Indian kingdom, and its influence progressively expanded southward and eastward at this time. The Grand Trunk Road, expanding from the wealthy eastern provinces to Kabul, was its main trade artery, and perhaps influenced by their Mongol ancestors, the Mughals made sure to make trade easy and streamlined from one end of the vast empire to the other. At this point, it was ruled by Aurangzeb, who was as of 1680 a mediocre ruler, who slightly expanded the borders to the east by conquering Coonch Behar (just south of Bhutan), but an invasion of Assam during the monsoon season led to the death of Mir Jumla, the supreme commander of the Mughal armies. The Maratha Empire emerged from the decaying Bijapur Sultanate to raid the great trading centre of Surat and threaten Mughal expansion, resulting in a long war between the two. Two Afghan rebellions in quick succession, one by the Afridi and another by the Yusufzai, both of which were crushed, and then the Rajputs rebelled, with the two major Rajput kingdoms still in rebellion as of 1680.",
    "Skardu":"Skardu was in decline at this time, having at one time conquered land as far as Chitral, in modern-day northwestern Pakistan, and collected tribute as far as Ladakh, but at this point it was weak, as much of its eastern territory fractured and Ladakh fell into Mughal orbit. At around this time, Europeans visited Skardu, noting its highly Tibetic culture (albeit its Islamic faith) and calling it \"Little Tibet\" as a result.",
    "Ladakh":"Ladakh was in the middle of a war at this time with Tibet. Having long ago broke away from the territorial control of the Dalai Lama, it slowly became more and more Mughal-influenced, with Aurangzeb creating a mosque in Leh. Even today, despite many cultural similarities with Tibet, Ladakh is more Indianized and has a much larger Muslim minority than Tibet. In its war with Tibet, it got the help of the Mughal Empire, and when the war came to an end, it ultimately retained its independence.",
    "Garhwal":"Garhwal fiercely resisted the Mughal Empire with all its wrath, and notably after successfully defeating an invasion, Garhwal's queen Karnavati ordered the noses of prisoners cut off before they were returned, resulting her being given the nickname Nakati Rani (Nose-Cutting Queen). However, more recently, the Mughal tributary of Kumaon was successfully able to invade the southern, rich parts of Garhwal, where terrain was less mountainous.",
    "Bhutan":"Bhutan was unified by Ngawang Namgyal, who resisted the temporal and territorial control of the Dalai Lama successfully, and as was normal in the region, the nation was melded with theocracy. Although he died in 1651, Namgyal's death was kept a secret by the government, which wished to avoid the kingdom fracturing. At around this time, the kingdom planned some invasions of Sikkim, which were put into action in the following decade, as well as supporting Ladakh against the giant that was Tibet."}
