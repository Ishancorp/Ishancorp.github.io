<h1>History of parties</h1>
<span class="anchor" id="union-party"></span>
<h2>Union Party</h2>
<section >
<p>-formed by republicans aligned with Henry Clay and his American System</p>
<p>-includes clintonians connected with irish catholic political machines</p>
<p>-pro-bank of us, tarriffs, internal improvements</p>
<p>-also pro-military development to prevent military bombardment as</p>
<p>-included madisonian republicans, some federalists, and those converted to cause</p>
<p>-later ate up anti-catholic party after henry clay's attempts to court catholic vote beaten</p>
<p>-split for an election over missouri crisis, but crisis got diffused and reunification occurred</p>
<p>-becomes opposed to "extreme" territorial expansion that might cause a sectional crisis, also seeks to bring system further</p>
<p>-elitist character becomes increasingly apparent, blamed for economic panic</p>
<p>-young america movement takes parts of its agenda, along with populistic criticisms of it, meshes it with their own stuff, ethos shapes stockton era</p>
<p>-menefee's ascent in 1860 sees its unity threatened over slavery and expansion questions, eventually over buenaventura recognition north and south break up</p>
<p>-in various states unionist party forms coalitions with pro-buenaventura populists, also with liberty party</p>
<p>-woodward continues to worsen issue, results in coalitions getting bigger, known as justice party</p>
<p>-by 1866 party is dead except for some minor stragglers who keep label alive</p>
<p>-despite many who wish to revive unionist party, growing scale of crisis, ties to abolitionist elements, and woodward's shittiness makes it impossible</p>
<p>-till <a class="" href="../..\wars\us's-wars\liberty-and-union-war-(1868-76).html" target="_self">Liberty and Union War (1868-76)</a> results in sweeping radicalism</p>
</section >
<span class="anchor" id="people's-party"></span>
<h2>People's Party</h2>
<section >
<p>-formed by republicans opposed to Henry Clay and his American System</p>
<p>-tammany hall gets shaped, successfully beats national republicans party at getting catholic votes</p>
<p>-martin van buren is big mover in its formation, backs zebulon pike as useful war hero to get party in power</p>
<p>-he proves less than effective, populists serve in opposition for long time afterwards</p>
<p>-van buren keeps party united despite much attempts at backstabbing and the like</p>
<p>-finally in 1852 gets stockton elected president, but to grief of much party he's "young america", takes some ideas from unionist party</p>
<p>-shapes anti-elite ethos of era deeply in form of populist streak</p>
<p>-but then stockton stumbles, unionist gets elected</p>
<p>-buenaventuro war of independence causes major fissures, but party rallies behind chief justice woodward</p>
<p>-fissures get worse and worse, by 1866 much of populists have bolted and joined oppositionist coalitions</p>
<p>-woodward gets tossed by own party in favour of southerner</p>
<p>-after justicialists win, much of populists see red, storming of capitol etc.</p>
<p>-some populists remain within constitutionalist government, some rally behind it, other try to restore "union as it was"</p>
<p>-peace populists surge, but 1872 sees total and utter defeat in every state due to justicialist alliance with war populists</p>
<p>-party lingers on after war behind white supremacy, tries and fails to form coalition with defecting liberal justicialists</p>
<p>-but eventually collapses and just withers away with success of reconstruction</p>

<p>-formed by two major elements: northern unionists and defecting northern populists</p>

<p>-in 1866 midterms coalition surges in the polls, successfully nominates oppositionist as speaker of house of representatives</p>
<p>-constant fighting with woodward and his doughface agenda results in party increasingly becoming organized</p>
<p>-holds convention in 1868, nominates moderate ticket that wins</p>
<p>-but still results in constitutional crisis, then civil war in defence of republican institutions</p>
<p>-party becomes progressively more radical over course of civil war, supports racial equality</p>
<p>-results in radical reconstruction, which is ultimately successful but long process</p>
<p>-48 years of justicialist dominance over presidency ensue (1868-1916)</p>
<p>-spearheads development of political machines, both in south and north (with migrating black people)</p>

<p>-earlier wave of irish immigrants, their association with anti-tammany clinton, sees tammany remain nativist & restricted to "native-born patriots"</p>
<p>-but not for anti-catholics, when samuel morse becomes mayor of ny tammany is only reluctantly affiliated de facto</p>
<p>-remains "in play" at natl level as clinton dies & both parties appeal to irish immigrants</p>

<h1>Tammany Societies</h1>
<br>
<section >
<p>-named after lenape chief associated with friendship</p>
<p>-as with otl, societies spread from philly across us, which participate in garish native american caricature ceremonies</p>
<p>-unlike otl, most of them aren't killed off due to no war of 1812 (which made native ritualism highly unpopular)</p>
<p>-instead, they live on, spread west</p>
<p>-concerns over secrecy result in many of them transforming into benevolent societies, arms of local republican parties</p>
<p>-luisiana war gives many of them nativist tint</p>
<p>-postwar, rise of clay puts many of them into opposition to clay, divided on which candidate to endorse</p>
<p>-backs pike fully, plays very prominent role as his grassroots</p>
<p>-but none as prominent as new yorks</p>
<p>-falls apart during 1860s, numerous basically wither and die as members join comunero clubs instead</p>
<p>-with <a class="" href="../..\wars\us's-wars\liberty-and-union-war-(1868-76).html" target="_self">Liberty and Union War (1868-76)</a>, uniformly support richmondites, new york's tammany tries to rebel and gets slap down</p>
