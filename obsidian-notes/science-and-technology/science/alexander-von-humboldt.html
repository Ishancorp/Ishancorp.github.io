<article>
<section>
<p>The Prussian scientist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769-1859) made his name with his famous, iconic 1799-1804 expedition to Spanish America. In this expedition, he explored much. He discovered a great amount of data with respect to animal biology, botany, geology, meteorology. To present this data, he had to invent isothermal lines and, most famously, he drew a map of the Andean volcano of Chimborazo, then believed to be the largest mountain in the world, which incorporated vast amounts of data from plant geography to altitude to humidity to air pressure. Furthermore, he wrote much about the people of Spanish America and their general sentiments, while at the same time criticizing colonialism and its myriad abuses, especially slavery. He compiled a massive, truly massive amount of data and spent the rest of his life publishing this data, data which with every stage deeply shaped the scientific world. Furthermore, he wrote about this expedition and published books about it intended for the public at large. These books helped to popularize science in terms that could be understood by laypeople and made him, for over half a century, the international face of science. The Venezuelan freedom fighter Simon Bolivar famously declared, "The real discoverer of South America was Humboldt, since his work was more useful for our people than the work of all conquerors". Even today he is internationally beloved, to the extent that the capital of the Republic of Columbia is named after him.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>If he had ended his career in 1804 he would have still been all of those things. But he was not one to rest; he wanted to go further. Having thoroughly catalogued and collected data of the Andes, he wanted to do the same for the other great mountain range of the world, the Himalayas. At the same time, for him, Europe was a stifling place. But to visit the Himalayas required the approval of the British East India Company, a company so powerful it was essentially a state. Already suspicious of letting non-British foreigners visit India, Humboldt's reputation as a critic of colonialism, who talked of the "cruelty of the Europeans", only made them more suspicious. That, in his <em>Political Essay on the Kingdom of New Spain</em>, he compared South American colonialism to Indian colonialism made them fearful he would expose the horrors of colonialism to political opinion. And so, they delayed and delayed the issue, and Humboldt lived in Paris and London where he organized his South American data and published it and entered into long correspondences with other European scientists. His chance finally came after his friend George Canning was appointed the Governor-General of <a href="../..\countries\asia\the-british-raj.html" target="_self">The British Raj</a> in 1822. Canning successfully secured for him permissions to travel to India, and after extensive planning, in 1824 he finally left London to India.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>He first visited Constantinople, and after greeting the Sublime Porte and finding, to his surprise, copies of his books, he travelled inland to Mount Ararat in modern-day Armenia. He busily catalogued the landscapes on his way, as well as the general state of the region in the era. From there, he travelled southwards overland, crossing the Zagros. Along this vast journey, he required many sets of interpreters; famously, to talk to Assyrians he first needed one interpreter to translate his French into Turkish, another to translate this Turkish into Armenian, and finally a last interpreter to translate this Armenian into Assyrian. In this long journey across inland territories, locals were fascinated with him, this exotic foreigner, and it was a sentiment he took merrily in stride as he collected data. Finally, he reached Bandar Abbas, where British traders eagerly anticipated him and jumped at the opportunity to greet him. On such a vessel, he sailed to Calcutta and finally greeted his good friend Canning there, who ensured he had complete freedom to travel regardless of East India corporate suspicions.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>From there he planned many travels into the Himalayas. First, he visited Darjeeling, years before it became a tea plantation, and he found its temperate weather pleasant even as the high altitudes on the way there caused him to bleed out of his eyes and nose. Here, he measured the heights of various mountains in the area and travelled as far up one of them as he could before the high altitudes got to him. But he wanted to go further; he wanted to compile data of the highest mountains of the Himalayas. Contemporary trigonometric surveys determined that, despite what had been believed, Chimborazo was not the highest mountain in the world, and that instead it was Dhaulagiri in the Kingdom of Nepal; more recently, it has been discovered that Chimborazo does contain the point on the Earth furthest from its centre due to the oblate nature of the planet. </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>Successfully gaining access into the hermit kingdom, he recorded the heights of mountains in its vicinity with surveying equipment, and he also catalogued the various plant life he found there. When he couldn't go up any more, he got his aides to collect whatever moss and lichens they could, and he categorized them delicately based on his telescope. Confident with his newly compiled data, he finally travelled southwards and returned to Calcutta to recover from the injuries the high altitudes gave him. Notably, he escaped the regime change in the British Raj caused by the Popular Revolution in 1827, though he did witness the army mutinies of its aftermath. </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>Finally, Humboldt decided to stay closer to sea level and travelled up the Ganges to record observations and collect volumes upon volumes of useful data about every facet of Indian geography, botany, fauna, and climate. However, he increasingly came face to face with the horrors of Indian colonialism as a result, and he found it every bit as horrible as that colonialism of Spanish America. He came face-to-face with the cruel justice system, the material poverty, and the clear wealth drain. It was an encounter that affected him, one which gave him a more global view of the horrors of colonialism.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>Finally, he returned to Europe in 1831, after five years in India. Here, he compared the data he discovered of the Andes, of Mount Ararat, and of the Himalayas in a lengthy scientific paper that would go on to be highly significant in the discovery of evolution and natural selection, and drew famous diagrams of Mount Ararat and Dhaulagiri to accompany the one of Chimborazo. He had much data to publish, in a process that lasted well after his death. But it was in 1832 when he wrote and published the <em>Political Essay on the Holdings of the Honorable East India Company</em> that he caused political earthquakes. It was a book that was deeply, deeply critical of colonialism and of the East India Company and of the myriad abuses he had witnessed, of British administrators forcing starving farmers to grow cash crops, of the regular use of forced labour, and of the economic drain. </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>In the <a href="../..\countries\europe\british-isles.html" target="_self">British Isles</a>, where the topic of reforming East India administration had long been a topic of the most raucous political debate, the <em>Political Essay</em> resulted in the East India Company being entirely removed from any role in administering India, in a move intended to quell this criticism and, to an extent, the abuses. It didn't work, but nevertheless the removal of the Company Raj, combined with the chaotic post-Revolutionary period of politics, quelled debate. Despite that during the 1837-1839 Agra Famine, the Irish nationalist Daniel O'Connell pointed to the <em>Political Essay</em> as proof of East India abuses that needed to be fixed, it took the rise of Indian independence movements in the late nineteenth century for it to be truly brought to the surface. The <em>Political Essay</em>'s continued relevance was such that translations of it would be found in the palms of freedom fighters during the <a href="../..\wars\british-wars.html#hindustani-war-of-independence-(1936-9)" target="_self">British Wars > Hindustani War of Independence (1936-9)</a>, and while modern Hindustan has torn down and destroyed almost all of the statues of Europeans built by the Britishers, Humboldt's is one of the few not only to be left untouched but to be treated as a national monument.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>In its wake, Humboldt published many books on his India expedition, on his trips to the Himalayas and on his scientific discoveries, and they proved enormously popular in his day. It only added to his enormous legacy as a titan of science, a foe of colonialism, and the inventor of nature. With his attacks on colonialism vindicated a million times over, and with his holistic view of the unity science making a vast comeback, it has only added to the great renaissance of him and his legacy.</p>
