Universal Expositions are held to show the achievements and innovations of nations through the presentation of cutting edge innovations and demonstrating modernity to the world at large. While varying in theme and character, they are consistently moments of national and municipal identity-building.  </p>

Expos emerged out of industrial exhibitions, which emerged out of the Industrial Revolution. The first one of these generally held to be notable occurred in Prague in 1791, aimed at promoting the budding Bohemian identity of the era by displaying the industry of the nation. In this it proved largely successful, and today Prague continues to host the Bohemian Industrial Exposition, an annual event to present the achievements of national industry and, by doing so, promoting unity between Germans and Czechs in the <a href="..\countries\europe\kingdom-of-bohemia.html" target="_self">Kingdom of Bohemia</a>.  </p>

France, however, would turn it into something more international. The French Revolution was a period of immense uncertainty and chaos, and so the Directory which sought to close that uncertainty sponsored industrial expositions. Their goal was to declare that the root of the <a href="..\countries\europe\french-republic.html" target="_self">French Republic</a> was not revolutionary violence, but industry, which it sought to promote, and to show that France could rival the British. The 1798 Industrial Exposition saw manufacturers from across France present their products from scientific equipment to china and glassware to silk, and the best were given awards in the form gold metals. Following the overthrow of the Directory, these events did not end; the next French Industrial Expo was held in 1803, then another 1805, and then the Council of State declared they would be held every three years. Gradually escalating, it was in 1844, with the Industrial Revolution truly underway in the Flanders and Rhineland regions of France, that they turned into something grander. The <strong>Exposition de l'Industrie Universelle (1844)</strong> was a much grander event - and guests from across Europe were invited to attend and even present some of their own products. Held in the Champ de Mars, the event was centred around the innovative Temple des Fenêtres, a building constructed with innovative techniques entirely with glass and iron; itself a manufacturing wonder, it became a symbol of the era - however, visitors from more reactionary states, Russia in particular, shuddered at it and regarded it as an unnatural republican abomination. Other grand, temporary buildings presented visitors with a more typical French exuberance. This event was an extraordinary success and it impressed many. The Temple des Fenêtres would be made permanent and made the centre of the annual French National Exposition, held annually.  </p>

<br>
<section>
<p>
Not one to be outshone, the <a href="..\countries\europe\british-isles.html" target="_self">British Isles</a> planned its own event. The outbreak of war in Europe led to it deciding to delay its plans, and finally, the <strong>Grand Festival of Industry of All the Nations (1855)</strong> was held in London. Held as it was only a few decades after the Popular Revolution and under a decade of the end of the disorder of the Headless State period, it aimed at exhibiting a newfound stability to the world at large. Its centrepiece, Fox Palace, was a glass building twice as large as the Temple des Fenêtres, and brought along were so many products that further temporary buildings needed to be constructed to house them. And along the Thames, the Monument to the Charter of Liberties and Securities, a 152 metre victory column in honor of the Revolution's most tangible achievement, too saw its unveiling, and it became the tallest structure in the world. In this, it proved a large success and improved Britain's reputation as a whole. In the eyes of Europe, no longer was post-revolutionary Britain a land of highwaymen and wild militias, but instead a great manufacturing shop aloof from the mainland.  </p>

France, seeking to outdo Britain in turn, held the <strong>Exposition de l'Industrie Universelle (1859)</strong>, holding it in Cologne in the Rhineland as a pointed refutation of German irredentism. As such, a few German states boycotted it, and in turn the French government made sure to give German and Bohemian political exiles special pavilions. This made this expo more explicitly a cultural and political event. This, however, did not mean that France wanted to turn away German visitors, and many still came. The event would ultimately have a profound impact on Cologne, and the many different cultural pavilions displayed there presaged the later migrations that turned it into a cultural melting pot. But in turn this led the Austrian government to retaliate, and it decided to hold the <strong>Deutsche Weltausstellung (1865)</strong> in Frankfurt, in part as a great display of German unity against the French. This colossal event served as a spotlight on the rising industries of lands considered Germany - the Eastern Ruhr, Saxony and (more controversially) Bohemia - with Austria seeking to serve as its head, and above all with the Reichsadler flying over the Palast der Industrie.  </p>

As the Habsburgs made sure to exclude Prussia from this "pan-German" expo, it led to it holding its own <strong>Preußische Weltausstellung (1869)</strong> in Berlin. In this it spotlighted its industry from its growing centre of Silesia, and it also made sure to include products from its great Polish and Lithuanian populations. However, its attempts to undermine Austrian pan-Germanism by inviting German states to erect their own pavilions generally failed. But nevertheless, it did well in showcasing Prussian industry. Britain held another <strong>Grand Festival of Industry of All the Nations (1871)</strong>, seeking to outdo France from 1859, and it successfully demonstrated the great advances from the 1855 Festival. Notably, it even reused Fox Palace, which remained as striking as ever.  </p>

In honor of the Mazzinian constitutional revisions that turned it from a confederacy of French-aligned sister republics into a fiercely independent federation, and to assert its independence from France, Italy decided to hold its own Expo. The <strong>Esposizione Internazionale dell'Industria (1874)</strong>, held not in the half-French metropolis of Milan but in the ancient capital of Rome, consecrated Italian industry. It was a celebration of Italy's history along with a promise of its future, and many were amazed at the Palazzo della Repubblica, which seamlessly joined neoclassicalism with iron modernity. However, this expo caused an international incident; the Pope, in exile in Madrid, formally condemned it, and many Catholic countries refused to send pavilions. But despite it all, it showed a new Italy, breaking away from being France's vassal and instead a power of its own; the tumult of the 1880s would be but the final event of this.  </p>

<p>
In 1879, the Expo crossed the shore. The <a href="..\countries\americas\united-states-of-america.html" target="_self">United States of America</a> was mired in civil war from 1869 to 1876; its beginning with a disputed election threw the entire American experiment in doubt, but its victory by the Constitutionalists, the flight of the Richmondites from Mobile over the water, and the destruction of slavery, brought it new hopes. The <strong>Centennial Festival (1879)</strong> was a representation of this. Held in Philadelphia, in honor of its role as capital both in the first years of the republic and the first few months of the Civil War, and a slightly belated mass celebration of the Centennial, it was a massive festival with more than 300 buildings displaying virtually every facet of American public life, as well as many of the innovations that would transform American life in the Reconstruction Era. It was also a firmly patriotic event, and it was fully decked in the purple flags and Phrygian caps used as emblems by the Comunero Clubs and the Justice Party. However, it is best known for the tragedy that ended it. President John Wentworth was shaking hands with the public when a man shot at his chest, killing him instantly. Veterans immediately stopped him from fleeing, and when questioned he was revealed to be a sympathizer for the Congress over the Water, operating as part of a terrorist cell calling itself the "Secret Service of the True Government of the United States". In its wake, crowds became frenzied and tore apart the temporary buildings before they could be brought under control. Attempts to continue it notwithstanding, it came to an end, and Philadelphia attained infamy for the Expo despite its initial success.  </p>
</section>
<br>
<section>
<p>
For all that the Centennial Festival ended in tragedy, it nevertheless opened the door to other Expos across the pond. The next city to do this was Montreal, with the <strong>Exposition de l'Industrie Canadienne (1883)</strong>. This emerged in a peculiar time; though Montreal was indisputably the grandest city in British North America, Lower Canada was facing a moral crisis. The expansion of Upper Canada to the Rockies and open talk of it getting the remainder of the North-West, made Lower Canada a small country. Internationally, when people talked of Canadians, they no longer meant Francophone Lower Canadians, but rather Anglophone Upper Canadians. The 1883 Expo was an attempt to change that. International visitors, though less than the norm due to the German Unification War brewing in Europe, were impressed at not only the extravagance of the festival, but also the city itself, as modern and industrializing as any great American city, and visitors would find themselves intrigued by its bilingualism and diversity. It proved a grand success in this regard, and it remains commemorated in Montreal to this day - even if it did not succeed in taking back the name Canadian.  </p>

The Netherlands, since 1795 a sister republic of France, suddenly broke its alliance in 1880 and refused to join it in the German Unification War. This inspired a period of war scares and sudden anxieties of being left defenceless; to improve this mood and assert its independence against both the French and the Germans, the Government planned an Expo of its own. One year following the conclusion of the German Unification War, it held the <strong>Bataafse Wereldtentoonstelling (1886)</strong> in Amsterdam, a massive celebration of Dutch culture and industry. It showed products from all around the Dutch Empire, from Kaapenaar wine to Javanese coffee to Guianese sugar - all revealing of its desires to maintain a new aloofness from European chaos, and to portray itself as a large country.  </p>
</section>
<br>

<p>
Meanwhile, the United States was still angry over the Centennial Festival. Though the Cuban War of Independence forced the Congress Over the Water from Havana to Belem, it did not erase that a sitting president was killed by a terrorist inspired by their ideology, and Philadelphia in particular sought to show its defiance. And so, it held the <strong>Constitution Festival (1887)</strong> in honor of the centennial of the Constitution, an event as great as, if not greater than, the Centennial was meant to be - though few could ignore that the streets were well-patrolled by the new Civil Guard. And when President Chamberlain attended the Festival, many held their breath - but no assassin or terrorist came running, and Chamberlain attended it as defiantly as ever. But most magnificent of all was the presentation of the world's new tallest structure, the National Liberty Pole, a 305-metre tower of iron framed by a cone of lattice with an observation deck at the top, with its roof shaped like a Phrygian cap in honor of the Civil War, and above that an American flag. During the Festival, it also served as a great lamp illuminating the city - to the detriment of Philadelphians' sleep schedules. It was a grand success, and it showed the world the rising power of America.  </p>

1889 was, momentously, the centennial of the French Revolution, and despite feelings of malaise from its defeat following the German Unification War, France sought to celebrate it grandly. Therefore, the <strong>Exposition de la Revolution (1889)</strong> was a grand celebration of the French Revolution and the joyous achievements of French nationhood afterwards. The monarchies of Europe shuddered as they watched the storming of the Bastille re-enacted complete with the burning of a wood replica. And that famous symbol of France, the grand Marianne statue seated on her throne with the Declaration of Rights of Man on one hand and the French flag in the other and a Phrygian cap on her head, was unveiled to the public at large. Imminent too was a newfound centrality of French language and culture, product of the ethnic nationalism stoked by the war - no longer were there multiethnic pavilions but instead a celebration of one country, one language pervaded the whole expo. And though German visitors were welcomed, many of them were met with scorn.  </p>

<p>
Despite Europe shortly afterwards consumed with yet more war with the outbreak of the Hungarian War of Independence, two more Expos were held during it. The <strong>Columbus Exposition (1892)</strong>, commemorating the 400th anniversary of Columbus' voyage, celebrated the rapid growth of San Francisco and its transformation from the city burnt by retreating Spanish troops in 1867 to the great cosmopolitan and commercial centre of the new country of Buenaventura. While in British Australia, the long-feuding cities of Sydney and Foxton held rival Expos, the <strong>Sydney Industrial Festival (1893)</strong> and the <strong>Foxton Industrial Festival (1894)</strong>. Postwar, despite the loss of Hungary, Germany held the <strong>Deutsche Weltausstellung (1896)</strong> in Frankfurt as a celebration of German culture, and soon afterwards Prague held the <strong>Národní Průmyslová Výstava (1898)</strong> to assert Bohemian identity against the new German behemoth it was now tied to, and in the same year Hungary held the <strong>Országos Világkiállítás (1898)</strong> in celebration of its reclaimed independence. It was clear to everyone that Expos were getting out of control and becoming unprofitable. For this reason, in the spirit of the era's growing internationalism, nations formed the International Forum Committee for World Expos (Comité du Forum International pour les Expositions Universelles; CFIEU) under the augeis of the <a href="..\world\international-forum.html" target="_self">International Forum</a> to grant countries the right to hold them.  </p>

The first expo held under this new system was the <strong>Pan-American Exposition (1903)</strong> held in St. Louis. Visitors who remembered the city being a battlefield during the Civil War were amazed at the modern, booming city that had recently become the second-largest city in the United States and, with the destruction of the Congress over the Water following the Internationalization of Grao-Para, one which had put the Civil War decisively in the past. The unveiling to the world of the steel Union Tower, resembling six arch lattice bridges merged together and topped with a mast, and its height of 343 metres making it taller than any structure built up to that point, would amaze visitors, and it having been painted patriotic purple in honor of the Civil War, made it as great a nationalist monument as the National Liberty Pole. To call this Expo a success would be a massive understatement; rather, it would be remembered by St. Louisans for decades to come as defining its self-image as America's second city.  </p>

Though neighbouring Buenaventura planned an Expo in San Francisco for 1907, the 1906 earthquake meant it had far larger issues to deal with. Instead, Prussia held the <strong>Preußische Weltausstellung (1909)</strong> in Berlin, a full-throated refutation of the Habsburgs' leadership of Germany and a celebration of Prussia's many diverse cultures. Visitors were presented with a dizzying variety of peoples, from Prussogermans to Poles to Lithuanians to Silesians, and the now truly vast industrial capacity of Silesia was presented to the rest of the world. The event, displaying a diverse array of peoples, was a success which showed a harmonious country pointed to the future, under its king.  </p>

The next country to hold an Expo was not any country in the west, but one in Asia. Punjab had sought to hold one for some time, to celebrate the Punjabi Revolution that turned it from a feudal monarchy into a modern centralized <a href="..\countries\asia\punjabi-republic.html" target="_self">Punjabi Republic</a> - and if some spoke negatively about its tendencies towards military dictatorship, most ignored them. But the CFIEU had been wholly reluctant to hold one there - unsubtly, this was for racial reasons as much as shudders of its violence. Finally, it relented, and Punjab held the <strong>Prudurshunee-e-Dooneeyah (1912)</strong> in Lahore. Many were impressed by Punjab's impressive modernization, with buildings rivaling any in Europe, citizens dressed in the finest European suits, and a new coffee culture rivalling that of France or the Netherlands. And the products of its newfound industrialization were presented to the world, and in particular this shaped the ideas of visitors from the neighbouring British Raj who hoped for effecting something similar in their homelands. This event had a deep impact on the vision of Punjab abroad and showed a nation on the cusp of modernization to the world at large.  </p>

Soon afterwards, the Expo would return to San Francisco. The 1906 earthquake flattened the city almost entirely, and its economic shockwaves devastated Buenaventura's economy. But with rapid speed, the city was reconstructed, larger and better than before, suburbs were annexed to it, and new immigrants came in. The iconic city of today, of neoclassical midrises, came into its own in this time. And to show this recovery, it held the <strong>Resurgence Exposition (1915)</strong>. A few blocks in the Presidio were made the site of the Expo, with grand buildings meant to last to posterity. The extravagant pavilions and palaces constructed for it amazed visitors, as did all the new streetcars which allowed them to travel without tiring themselves up and down the city's infamous hills. The Expo reached its peak with the unveiling with the great Statue of Queen Califia, dressed (in contrast to the sixteenth-century fantasy novel in which she, and the name California, came to be) in Mayan-inspired garb and with a grand cape behind her. This statue was intended to show her as the "Spirit of California", but instead it quickly became a symbol of Buenaventura as a whole. Today, the Expo, showing a San Francisco resurgent, is still regarded as one of the defining moments in Buenaventuran history, as part of San Francisco's grand recovery from the disaster of 1906, and the neighbourhood around where it took place is still known as Expo today.</p>
